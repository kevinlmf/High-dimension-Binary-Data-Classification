# High-dimension-Binary-Data-Classification

This repository contains the honours thesis of **Mengfan Long**, submitted to the School of Economics, The University of Queensland, in October 2023.

The thesis proposes a novel approach to binary classification in high-dimensional settings using Gaussian mixture models and the CHIME algorithm (Clustering of High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with EM).
